# Transfer Learning for Face Classification (Gender, Race, and Age)

In this notebook, we will use this [dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) which contains 20000 photos of people from 0 to 116 years old (the version in which all pictures are of the same size with faces centered). Classification targets are gender (male/female), race (white/black/asian/indian/other), and age. Transfer learning and fine-tuning will be used in the classification process.
